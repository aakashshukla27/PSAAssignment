Algorithmic Benchmarking
Benchmarking is the method of comparing performance of algorithms with respect to certain predefined set of tests against it.
In our experiments we will be running the benchmark tests on an implementation of insertion sort and determine its performance in 4 major scenarios when the algorithm is fed â€“ sorted input, input that is sorted but I reverse order, random input and semi sorted input. We will be comparing the runtime of the algorithm on an initial set of 100 values and will go on doubling the input size. We shall be running each cycle at least 100 times and calculate the mean runtime in case of every run. The system clock time will be recorded using the System.nanoTime() directive in java.
